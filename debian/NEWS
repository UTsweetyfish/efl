efl (1.23.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  This release includes significant changes:

  * autotools has been replaced by meson.  This results in numerous
    changes to how modules are built.
  * egl/gles is now the default on all architectures instead of just arm.
    Full OpenGL is no longer supported on Linux.
  * Wayland support is much improved.
