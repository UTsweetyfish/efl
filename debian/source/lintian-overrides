# This cycle cannot be removed.  libeio1 depends on libefreet1a, and
# libefreet1a requires libefreet-bin.  Since libefreet1a is MA: same
# and libefreet-bin is MA: foreign, they cannot be combined.  The
# libeio1 Depends on libefreet-bin is new to 1.25.  But I don't know
# why it wasn't generated before - the libefreet1a symbols file has
# required it since db5f4e3ecd2.

# Upstream is working on merging most EFL shared objects.  At that
# point, this will be eliminated.
